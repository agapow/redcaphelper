Design and development
----------------------

*Odd thoughts and ruminations, mostly justifying why things are the way they are.*

There's a lot of value in making a more powerful and more compact schema for
REDcap databases, but a lot of conflicting forces. The simple addition of a
few columns seems the best solution, you can easily make an old schema into
the new format with minial modification. This does set up a lot of parsing
issues (e.g. telling the difference between repetition of the rows and
sections). The qualifiers seem to simple solve this problem.

This approach allowed me to collapse a 3000 item data dictionary down into less than 600 rows, with a commensurate consistency in how items were named and
behaved.

This project went rapidly through several iterations and some of the code and design is frankly a bit ropey and could be better written. However, it works.
