redcaphelper can be installed in the usual sort of ways:

* Download the repo, unpack it if necessary and use ``setup.py``::

   % python setup.py install

* Use a package manager pointed at the git repository::

   > pip install git+https://github.com/agapow/redcaphelper.git

redcaphelper has been built under Python3 but should run under Python2.
