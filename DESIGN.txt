Design and development

*Odd thoughts and ruminations, mostly justifying why things are the way they are.*

Arguably, the Connection lass adds only a small amount to the base Project class. On the other hand, the "chunking" of uploads is unavoidable when dealing with big datafiles (say, more than a million cells), so they're important additions.

The scripts are also super important for automating REDCap tasks.

Some of the modules internal organisation is confused, reflects the evolution of the code and could arguably be refactored.

There's a whole lot of junk in the module that could be disposed of comfortably.
